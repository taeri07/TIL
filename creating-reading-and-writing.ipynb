But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand. Instead, we'll be working with data that already exists.\n\nData can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file. When you open a CSV file you get something that looks like this:\n\n```\nProduct A,Product B,Product C,\n30,21,9,\n35,34,1,\n41,11,11\n```\n\nSo a CSV file is a table of values separated by commas. Hence the name: \"Comma-Separated Values\", or CSV.\n\nLet's now set aside our toy datasets and see what a real dataset looks like when we read it into a DataFrame.
